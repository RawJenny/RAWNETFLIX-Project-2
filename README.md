RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Leverage Seasonal Trends to Maintain Revenue Growth

Since revenue peaked in October, Netflix should analyze contributing factors such as seasonal promotions, new content releases, or user behavior patterns. Implement similar strategies in other months to maintain steady growth.

 

2. Expand Targeted Marketing Efforts in High-Performing Countries

With the United States, Spain, and Canada generating the highest revenue, Netflix should focus on localized content, regional promotions, and exclusive offers to further increase subscriptions in these regions.

 

3. Optimize the Laptop Viewing Experience

Since laptops contribute the highest revenue, Netflix should enhance the laptop streaming experience by improving user interface, offering better offline viewing options, and optimizing streaming performance for browsers and apps.

 

4. Encourage Upgrades from Basic to Premium Plans

Given that the Basic plan generates the highest revenue, Netflix can introduce incentives for upgrading to Standard and Premium plans, such as better content access, family-sharing features, and personalized recommendations.

 

5. Enhance Personalization for Female Subscribers

With female users slightly contributing more revenue, Netflix should analyze content preferences among female viewers and tailor marketing campaigns, recommendations, and promotional content to enhance engagement and retention.

 

6. Develop Age-Specific Marketing Campaigns

Since 30-year-olds have the highest subscription rate, Netflix should tailor its content recommendations, email campaigns, and advertising strategies to align with this demographic's preferences and increase engagement across similar age groups.

 

7. Offer Incentives for Early Subscription Renewals

Since most payments occur between the 1st and 10th of each month, Netflix can introduce early renewal discounts, loyalty rewards, or auto-renewal benefits to encourage continued subscription.

 

8. Expand Regional Content for Canada and Spain

Given their strong revenue contributions, Netflix should invest in country-specific content for Canada and Spain, including original productions, dubbing/subtitling in local languages, and region-specific marketing campaigns.

 

9. Improve Smart TV Experience to Increase Revenue from TV Users

Since Smart TVs generate lower revenue compared to laptops and tablets, Netflix should focus on enhancing the Smart TV app, improving navigation, adding exclusive TV features, and optimizing streaming quality to drive higher engagement.

 

10. Implement Strategies to Stabilize Subscription Growth

To reduce fluctuations in revenue, Netflix should implement long-term retention strategies such as annual subscription discounts, bundled streaming offers, and exclusive content releases during off-peak months.
